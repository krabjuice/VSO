                    Here on Vouched Sellers Online, we provide lists of known and new sellers on various communication platforms.
                    Instead of constantly asking, "Is he vouched?" or "Is this an impersonator?" just come here and check.
                    Vouched Sellers Online does not accept donations, or payments to be listed as a vouched/verfied seller.
                    You can hover on anyone's username and it will display the general items they are selling.
                    You can click on anyone's @username to be redirected to a PM on Telegram directly so you're sure who you're talking to.

                    It'll take a few days to add everyone, so please be patient.
